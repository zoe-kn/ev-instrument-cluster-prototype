# EV Instrument Cluster Prototype

A minimal **electric vehicle instrument cluster** prototype.  
Focus is not visual polish but **HMI principles, cognitive load and information hierarchy** for driver-critical interfaces.

### 🎯 Goal
Practice thinking like a software & HMI engineer:
- Glanceability under real driving conditions
- Strict safety-first hierarchy (speed > assist > navigation)
- No touch UI elements (steering-wheel interaction implied)
- Minimal distraction, high legibility

### 🧠 What’s inside
- Speed as primary focus
- ACC status indicator (driver assistance context)
- Battery + Range block (EV relevant data)
- Navigation cue for next maneuver

### 🛠️ Stack / Tools
- Figma (Free)
- Iterative design to mimic automotive HMI workflows

### 📸 Screenshot (v1)

### ✅ Next steps
- Add State-Flow logic (Python CLI model)
- Add night mode variant
- Lane-assist indicator bars
