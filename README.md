# EV Cockpit HMI Prototype (Early Exploration)

This is a minimal digital instrument cluster concept for an electric vehicle.  
The focus is not on visuals, but on **automotive HMI thinking**:

- glanceability under driving conditions  
- strict information hierarchy  
- safety-first layout (no touch UI, no distractions)

Current elements:
- Speed as primary focal point
- ACC active indicator (driver assistance)
- Battery and range data (EV-relevant)
- Minimal navigation cue for next maneuver

This is an iterative learning project â€” not final UI work.  
Goal: practice structured interface thinking for automotive systems.
